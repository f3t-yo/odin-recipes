    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In this cauliflower rice pilaf, frozen riced cauliflower stands in for rice.<br>
        With a pretty yellow color from turmeric, and lots of flavor from shallots,<br>
        mushrooms, and carrots, this side dish is as savory as it is attractive.</p>
    
      <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2/3 cup diced shallots</li>
        <li>2/3 cup chopped fresh white mushrooms</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons shredded carrots</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chicken flavor bouillon base,<br>
             such as Better Than BouillonÂ®<br>
             Roasted Chicken Base</li>
        <li>1 pound frozen riced cauliflower</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced fresh parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. When butter sizzles, add <br>
                diced shallots and cook about 2 minutes. Add chopped mushrooms and cook, <br>
                stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add carrots, and sprinkle on turmeric, curry powder, and paprika. Stir <br>
                in minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. </li>
            <li>Add white wine and chicken flavor bouillon base. Stir until chicken base <br>
                is dissolved into the liquid. Cook, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. <br>
                See Cook's Note. </li>
            <li>Add frozen riced cauliflower, and use a fork to break up any clumps. Cook, <br>
                stirring occasionally, until all the liquid is evaporated and cauliflower is <br>
                tender, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in fresh minced parsley and <br>
                place in a serving  dish. Garnish with additional parsley, if desired. </li>
        </ol>
